# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.
        
        The background color and div colors were changes throughout the site to match MSU brand standards.
        The classic MSU green #18453b is used in the header and footer, as well as in the navigation text. 
        An MSU tan color #e8d9b5 is used to define the navigation bar.
        
2. Use a new font.

        I used the font "Gotham" to follow the MSU brand standards.

3. Include two images.
        
        I used images to represent Twitter on the contact page, as well as the logos for Sublime and Atom text editors.
        
4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.

        In addition to creating a table to increase the readability of the Grading Scale, I also broke up the pages of the website into color blocks to group information in an easy to understand way. 

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  

        I created a grid with three columns to group information, and made all of the group names h3. The groups are inside of a colored blocks. 

6. Add navgation to the Schedule webpage.

        The schedule page navigation uses the same format as all of the other pages, with the navigation bar on the left, main content on the right. Additionally, the navigation has a hover effect, is spaced out into even buttons and divided by lines.

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.

        By dividing the rows of the schedule with colored lines, I made the information clearer, while formatting the entire schedule page to match the rest of the site.
